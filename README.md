# RandomRush
The first game I created

Creating this game was my choice for my final project in my first year of college.
At the time, I didn't even know how to use GitHub, so it took me a while to post this game.

About the game:

Genre - 3rd person runner

The essence of the game is to run overcoming obstacles for as long as possible to get the best record, which is calculated in the number of seconds lived

The peculiarity of this game is that every 10 seconds, some random effect is applied, affecting the gameplay:

GRAVITY CHANGE - an effect that increases the character's attraction to the ground, causing the character to land much faster after a jump. Therefore, it is important to choose the right moment to jump, jumping not in advance but right in front of an obstacle.

SIZE CHANGE - an effect that changes the character's size, which can both help and hinder the character. To avoid this effect, it is recommended to perform a roll to cancel it.

SPEED CHANGE - an effect that changes the character's speed, speeding up gameplay, so you need to react as quickly as possible to perform evasive actions in time.

EFFECTS RESET - resets all applied effects, allowing you to breathe a sigh of relief and relax for the next 10 seconds.

CHAOS MODE is the most challenging gameplay effect that completely inverts character controls.
